- - What problem does this dataset aim to solve?
  - This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.
- - What was the inspiration for this dataset? 
  - I was always astonished by how each of the restaurants are able to keep up the pace inspite of that cutting edge competition, and what factors should be kept in mind if someone wants to open new restaurant.
- - How was the dataset constructed?
  - The data was scraped from Zomato in two phases. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars.
- - Describe Phase 1?
  - In Phase I of extraction only the URL, name and address of the restaurant were extracted which were visible on the front page. The URl's for each of the restaurants on the zomato were recorded in the csv file so that later the data can be extracted individually for each restaurant. This made the extraction process easier and reduced the extra load on my machine. The data for each neighborhood and each category can be found here
- - Describe Phase 2? 
  - In Phase II the recorded data for each restaurant and each category was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 15 variables were scraped in this phase. For each of the neighborhood and for each category their online_order, book_table, rate, votes, phone, location, rest_type, dish_liked, cuisines, approx_cost(for two people), reviews_list, menu_item was extracted. See section 5 for more details about the variables.
- - When was the dataset's last update?
  - The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019.
